# Synkrisis

Synkrisis is a bigraph modelling and engineering toolchain sporting a modular approach.  
It features static analysis for bigraph specification and will eventually support its own transition system and model exporting for DTMCs/LTSs/KSs analysis.  
This starts as intellij repo and will be further expanded and documented in the future.  
Further infos on bigraph and the syntax behind Synkrisis can be found in the wiki.
  
 Project is still under work and, as of now, unusable.
